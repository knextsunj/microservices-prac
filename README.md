Microservices Practice Code

This repository contains code modified to use maven instead of gradle and Spring MVC instead of Spring Web Flux for code examples given in the book 'Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud'

https://www.amazon.com/Microservices-Spring-Boot-Cloud-microservices/dp/1801072973

The original samples use gradle and Spring Web Flux which many newcomers may not know at the start.
